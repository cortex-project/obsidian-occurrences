# Development Guidelines for Cursor Agents

This document is designed to clarify on what patterns current match the intended architecture. When suggesting new code these patterns should be replicated as close as possible, but should not be considered entirely dogmatic.

If in the process of building a new feature an alternative pattern is worth considering we should still explore it and in the case we decide to proceed you should recommend updates to this file that better match the new approach

## Core Principles

- **Use native Obsidian Plugin API as much as possible** - Always check `node_modules/obsidian/obsidian.d.ts` for complete type definitions and prefer the use of these over building net new. When building new prefer to extend existing Obsidian classes when possible.
- **Attempt to match the look and feel of Obsidian** - Prefer to leverage existing Obsidian components, CSS classes, and variables. Limit the amount of additional CSS created. When creating new UI elements attempt to style in a manner that matches the existing UI
- **Maintain mobile app compatibility** - This plugin will be used in mobile as often as desktop. Do not recommend importing additional node modules as that will break the ability to load the plugin in mobile. Consider how component design will function on a device

## Development Context

**Single User Environment**: This plugin is currently used by only one developer. Breaking changes, experimental approaches, and direct migrations are acceptable since:

- Git rollback is always available for recovery
- No external users to impact with breaking changes
- Rapid iteration and testing is preferred over extensive safety measures
- The developer can handle debugging and fixing issues directly

When suggesting approaches, prefer:

- Direct implementation over overly cautious phased approaches
- "Move fast and fix issues" over "prevent all possible issues"
- Testing new approaches quickly rather than extensive planning
- Assuming the developer can debug and resolve problems

## Additional Requirements and Conventions

- All public methods should have JS docs
- Methods should be explicit in their purpose and avoid side effects that aren't obvious based on the name
- Event handling function should live directly in the registerEvents callback
- file.path is the only reliable unique identifier
- if file.path changes the corresponding item should be removed from memory and then added back with the new path index
- Each directory should have a clear single responsibility (data stores, UI components, form logic, etc.)
