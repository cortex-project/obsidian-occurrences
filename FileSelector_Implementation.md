## Component API

### FileSelector

interface FileSelection {
  isCurrentFile: boolean
  file?: TFile
  displayName: string
}

interface FileSelectorOptions {
  placeholder?: string
  debounceMs?: number
}
```

### SearchFilters (Updated)
```typescript
interface SearchFilters {
  search: boolean
  searchQuery: string
  currentFile: boolean
  inbox: boolean
  linksTo: boolean           // New
  linksToFile?: TFile | null // New
  linksToIsCurrentFile: boolean // New
}
```

## CSS Classes Added

### FileSelector Styles
- `.file-selector-container`
- `.file-selector-input-container`
- `.file-selector-icon`
- `.file-selector-input`
- `.file-selector-clear-button`
- `.file-selector-target-button`
- `.file-selector-suggestions`
- `.file-selector-suggestion`
- `.file-selector-suggestion-name`
- `.file-selector-suggestion-path`
- `.file-selector-no-results`

### SearchBar Styles
- `.search-container`
- `.search-input-container`
- `.search-input`
- `.search-input-clear-button`

## Behavior

### Normal Mode
1. User clicks the link button in header
2. FileSelector shows with input field and target button
3. User can type to search for files
4. Suggestions appear showing matching files
5. Selecting a file filters occurrences to show only links to that file

### Current Active File Mode
1. User clicks the target button (becomes active/highlighted)
2. Input shows "Current Active File"
3. Component listens to active-leaf-change events
4. Automatically updates when user switches to different files
5. Clicking target button again switches back to normal mode with current file name

### Filter Integration
- When linksTo filter is active, occurrences show files linking to the selected file
- When currentFile filter is active, shows occurrences for the currently active file
- Search and inbox filters work in combination with file selection
- All filters can be used independently or together

## Usage

```typescript
// Create FileSelector
const fileSelector = new FileSelector(
  app,
  container,
  (selection: FileSelection) => {
    console.log('File selected:', selection)
  },
  {
    placeholder: "Linking to...",
    debounceMs: 300
  }
)

// Show/hide
fileSelector.show()
fileSelector.hide()

// Get current selection
const selection = fileSelector.getSelection()

// Handle active file changes (for current file mode)
fileSelector.onActiveFileChange(newFile)
```

## Notes

The implementation follows Obsidian's design patterns and integrates seamlessly with the existing occurrences view. The component is fully functional and ready for use, with proper TypeScript typing and comprehensive CSS styling that matches Obsidian's UI conventions.
