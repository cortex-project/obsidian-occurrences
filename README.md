# Occurrences for Obsidian

## Getting Started

### Installing the plugin

After cloning the repo run `npm install`

### Running in Dev

Update the `outDir` in `esbuild.config.mjs` to match the path to your vault and
the directory you want the plugin to install into. Doing this will automatically
update the plugin on save. You will also need to refresh Obsidian to see those
changes.
